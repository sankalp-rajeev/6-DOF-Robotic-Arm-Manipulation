## Project Overview

The 6-DOF robotic arm project's primary objective was to ensure precise manipulation and coordination in tasks such as:
- Picking and placing objects within a designated 3-dimensional coordinate system.
- Programming the arm to render drawings derived from input images.

The robotic arm was equipped with:
- 6 RMD motors for efficient movement and articulation.
- CAN communication protocol ensuring smooth and reliable data transmission during operations.

Additionally, I played a pivotal role in enhancing the robotic arm's capabilities by:
- Integrating image classification features.
- Incorporating object detection mechanisms using a 3D depth camera.

## Skills Acquired and Applied

Throughout this project, I was able to hone and apply several skills including:

- **Machine Learning**: To enable and optimize image classification and object detection functionalities.
- **Object Detection & Computer Vision**: Leveraged for recognizing and mapping objects within the robotic arm's environment.
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: Employed to facilitate communication and control among the robotic arm's various components.
- **Programming**: Extensively used Python to program the robotic arm's tasks and operations.
- **Communication**: Ensured seamless data transmission through the CAN protocol.
- **Computer Science Fundamentals**: Applied to optimize and troubleshoot the robotic arm's software infrastructure.

## Conclusion

This internship offered me an invaluable opportunity to immerse myself in advanced robotics technology. The experience enriched my understanding and skills in the domain, laying a strong foundation for future endeavors in robotics and AI.
